To do list based on JS, not ruby, and webdb, has FlatUI

I have to admit this task was a bit more of a stretch for me than I would have thought at first glance. It was easy to 
using Rails, but much more was involved when only using HTMl, CSS, and JS.

I used the tutorial here walk my though this process: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webdatabase/todo/

I am confident in my understand of the functions and call backs. If this project were any more complicated I would
reccomend the use of an actual SQl db, not webdb. However for the simplicity it works. 

Lastly this was my first project that I used FlatUI on. I really like it and might try to apply it on future projects.
